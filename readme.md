# Facial Emotion Recognition Project üßê

This project uses a deep learning model to perform real-time facial emotion recognition. It can identify faces within an image and classify the emotion of each face into one of seven categories: **happy, surprise, sad, anger, disgust, fear, or neutral**.



## ‚ú® Features

* **Face Detection**: Uses OpenCV's highly reliable Haar Cascade classifier to locate faces in an image.
* **Emotion Classification**: Employs a pre-trained PyTorch model (`ResEmoteNet`) based on a ResNet architecture to classify emotions.
* **Visual Feedback**: Draws bounding boxes around detected faces and labels them with the predicted emotion.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

* **Python 3.8+**
* **PyTorch**: The deep learning framework used for the model.
* **OpenCV**: For image processing and face detection.
* **Pillow (PIL)**: For image manipulation and transformations.
* **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
